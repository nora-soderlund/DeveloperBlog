	(5, 'static-google-maps-coordinate-projection', 'Static Google Maps coordinate projection', '<p>Do you want to project coordinates to the screen when using the Google Maps Static API?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google Maps already provide customizing of static maps to an extent and in most cases, I would say what\'s available is more than enough. For example, you can render: <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/start#MapTypes">different map types</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/start#Markers">markers</a> (also with <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/start#CustomIcons">custom icons!</a>), and even <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/start#PathStyles">paths</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But say you want to introduce interaction in your static map, then in most cases you\'d actually need the JavaScript API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there are cases where you might still want/need to use the Static API:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>You want to conceal the coordinates.</li>\r\n    <p>Maybe for a competitive geoguesser game where you don\'t want the users to be able to find the coordinates through the JavaScript API.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <li>You want nothing but simplicity.</li>\r\n    <p>Maybe the Static Maps API has all you actually need but all you want to do is anchor a button or interactable label at a specific coordinate.</p>\r\n    <p><small>Or maybe you don\'t want any external sources in your website, like the JavaScript API.</small></p>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if you do want to project a world coordinate to a screen coordinate, there\'s three steps we have to take:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Calculating coordinates to world coordinates</li>\r\n    <p>First we need to translate our latitude and longitude coordinates into world coordinates according to the Mercator projection.</p>\r\n    <p><small>The Mercator projection is what Google uses to translate all coordinates input into the API to <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/coordinates#world-coordinates">world coordinates</a>.</small></p>\r\n    \r\n    <li>Calculating world coordinates to pixel coordinates</li>\r\n    <p>Before we can apply our coordinates, they need to be scaled to our zoom level - which is what pixel coordinates are.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <li>Calculating and applying the pixel coordinates</li>\r\n    <p>With all calculations at hand, we need to apply them for our scenario!</p>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Calculating the pixel offsets</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that on a regular request we can only input a search string or a coordinate - as the center of the map, the zoom level, and the canvas size; we have to use these 3 properties to make a calculation that aligns with the API\'s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you\'re working with search inputs, you should do the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview">geocoding</a> yourself, so that you\'re only working with coordinates with the Static Maps API. This is to ensure both the API and you are working with the same center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the request example I\'ll be working with in this article:</p>\r\n\r\n<syntax-highlight language="html">\r\n                  https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=58.3797273637364,12.324802043063467&zoom=15&size=250x250&key=API_KEY\r\n</syntax-highlight>\r\n\r\n<p><small>It\'s a 250x250 map of Vänersborg, Sweden at zoom level 15.</small></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google provides fantastic <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/coordinates#pixel-coordinates">transparent documentation</a> on how their coordinates are calculated and I\'ll be using this as a reference going forwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">Understanding the viewport</h3>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0"><small><i>Not to be confused with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/start#Viewports">visible viewport definition</a>.</i></small></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we can start, it\'s important that we understand how the viewport of the map works with dependency to the size parameter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><small>For example, this is a <i title="Zoom and size are relative, not absolute.">hypothetical</i> example of a 100x100 map:</small></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="article-vector">\r\n        <svg class="article-vector-grid" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 100 50" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\r\n                <defs>\r\n                        <pattern id="grid" width="5" height="5" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">\r\n                                 <path d="M 5 0 L 0 0 0 5" fill="none" stroke="#8b9bba" stroke-width=".2"/>\r\n                        </pattern>\r\n\r\n                        <pattern id="map" width="50" height="50" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">\r\n                                 <image x="0" y="0" width="50" height="50" href="/images/articles/static-maps-coordinate-projection/roadmap.jpg"/>\r\n                        </pattern>\r\n                </defs>\r\n              \r\n              <rect width="100" height="100" fill="url(#grid)"/>\r\n              <rect x="30" y="5" width="40" height="40" fill="url(#map)"/>\r\n              \r\n              <circle cx="50" cy="25" r="1" fill="red"/>\r\n        </svg>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><small>And this is the same <i title="Zoom and size are relative, not absolute.">hypothetical</i> map but sized 200x100:</small></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="article-vector">\r\n        <svg class="article-vector-grid" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 100 50" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\r\n                <defs>\r\n                        <pattern id="grid" width="5" height="5" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">\r\n                                 <path d="M 5 0 L 0 0 0 5" fill="none" stroke="#8b9bba" stroke-width=".2"/>\r\n                        </pattern>\r\n\r\n                        <pattern id="map" width="50" height="50" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">\r\n                                 <image x="0" y="0" width="50" height="50" href="/images/articles/static-maps-coordinate-projection/roadmap.jpg"/>\r\n                        </pattern>\r\n                </defs>\r\n              \r\n              <rect width="100" height="100" fill="url(#grid)"/>\r\n              <rect x="10" y="5" width="80" height="40" fill="url(#map)"/>\r\n              \r\n              <circle cx="50" cy="25" r="1" fill="red"/>\r\n        </svg>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can tell, the map expands by the size, anchored by the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is because the map projection that Google Maps uses for translating coordinates to world coordinates is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator projection</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the Mercator projection, Google Maps then uses pixel coordinates relative to the zoom level to create the boundaries of the returned map, centered by our coordinates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Calculating coordinates to world coordinates</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to convert our coordinates to world coordinates using the Mercator projection ourselves, this is so that we can use the Mercator projection to get pixel coordinates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using this Mercator projection, we can input our coordinates and get the world coordinates based on our map size:</p>\r\n\r\n<syntax-highlight language="javascript">\r\nfunction getMercatorWorldCoordinateProjection(width, height, latitude, longitude) {\r\n    let latitudeToRadians = ((latitude * Math.PI) / 180);\r\n    let mercN = Math.log(Math.tan((Math.PI / 4) + (latitudeToRadians / 2)));\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n        left: ((longitude + 180) * (width / 360)),\r\n        top: ((height / 2) - ((width * mercN) / (2 * Math.PI)))\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n</syntax-highlight>\r\n\r\n<h3>Calculating world coordinates to pixel coordinates</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we have our world coordinates, we have to take the zoom level into account.
